# AQS

[toc]

## 设计并发包需要考虑什么

1. 利用CAS，原子地修改共享标志位。
2. 等待策略：当无法获取资源时，是立即执行其他代码，还是阻塞该线程等待资源空闲。



## AQS是什么

`AQS`是一个`JUC`包里核心的抽象类，开发者使用`AQS`可以更方便实现各种同步机制，例如锁、信号量、倒计时器。



`AQS`的核心思想是基于一个**双向链表队列**和一个**状态值**（`volatile int state`）来实现同步。



state有什么用？



当线程尝试获取同步资源时，如果资源被占用，则线程被封装为`Node`并放入等待队列，并进入等待状态；当持有资源的线程释放资源时，则唤醒等待队列中的一个线程。



队列中，只需要让队头线程通过`CAS`获取锁，其余线程挂起。这样既提高了队头元素获取锁的速度，也避免了大量线程空转消耗CPU。

        /**
         * Status field, taking on only the values:
         *   SIGNAL:     The successor of this node is (or will soon be)
         *               blocked (via park), so the current node must
         *               unpark its successor when it releases or
         *               cancels. To avoid races, acquire methods must
         *               first indicate they need a signal,
         *               then retry the atomic acquire, and then,
         *               on failure, block.
         *   CANCELLED:  This node is cancelled due to timeout or interrupt.
         *               Nodes never leave this state. In particular,
         *               a thread with cancelled node never again blocks.
         *   CONDITION:  This node is currently on a condition queue.
         *               It will not be used as a sync queue node
         *               until transferred, at which time the status

         *               nothing to do with the other uses of the
         *               field, but simplifies mechanics.)
         *   PROPAGATE:  A releaseShared should be propagated to other
         *               nodes. This is set (for head node only) in
         *               doReleaseShared to ensure propagation
         *               continues, even if other operations have
         *               since intervened.
         *   0:          None of the above
         *
         * The values are arranged numerically to simplify use.
         * Non-negative values mean that a node doesn't need to
         * signal. So, most code doesn't need to check for particular
         * values, just for sign.
         *
         * The field is initialized to 0 for normal sync nodes, and
         * CONDITION for condition nodes.  It is modified using CAS
         * (or when possible, unconditional volatile writes).

## AQS核心方法

```java
tryAcquire(int);        // 尝试获取独占锁，可获取返回true，否则false
tryRelease(int);        // 尝试释放独占锁，可释放返回true，否则false
tryAcquireShared(int);  // 尝试以共享方式获取锁，失败返回负数，只能获取一次返回0，否则返回个数
tryReleaseShared(int);  // 尝试释放共享锁，可获取返回true，否则false
isHeldExclusively();    // 判断线程是否独占资源
```
